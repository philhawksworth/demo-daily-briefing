## Daily briefing example



## Prerequisites

This code will make use of a browser API which can only be used when accessed over a secure HTTPS connection. To configure your local development environment to serve requests over HTTPS you'll need to first create a certificate for local testing, and ensure that your local machine trusts that cert. The configuration of browsersync in Eleventy is [shown in the video](https://youtu.be/A_l0qrPUJds?t=157m40s)

- [Generate a free certificate for localhost](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/)
- [Trusting your local certificate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=75&v=TGrX8XgSuZ4)

By default, [sites on Netlify are automatically configured with a free certifcate](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=fcc-examples-pnh&utm_campaign=devex#certificate-service-types) provided by LetsEncrypt, so no additional steps will be required in the CI/CD and hosting environments.

## Local development

To work on this example locally, you can clone the repository and start editing, although there are a few pre-requisites:

- [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- A free [Netlify account](https://www.netlify.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=fcc-examples-pnh&utm_campaign=devex)
- A free [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) API key
- A free [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) API key

```bash

# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/philhawksworth/daily-briefing

# move into the working directory and install dependencies
cd daily-briefing
npm install

# build and start the local development server
npm start

# just run the build
npm run build

```
